  # SwiftTestFile.swift
  # Code Explanation

The provided code is written in Swift and consists of two functions and some code to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) and provide a health recommendation based on the calculated BMI.

### `calculateBMI` Function
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the BMI using the formula BMI = weight / (height * height).
- **Parameters**:
  - `weight`: Represents the weight of a person in kilograms.
  - `height`: Represents the height of a person in meters.
- **Return Value**: Returns the calculated BMI as a `Double`.

### `getHealthRecommendation` Function
- **Purpose**: This function provides a health recommendation based on the calculated BMI.
- **Parameters**:
  - `bmi`: Represents the Body Mass Index of a person.
- **Return Value**: Returns a health recommendation as a `String` based on the BMI range.
- **BMI Ranges and Recommendations**:
  - Less than 18.5: "Underweight - You should eat more nutritious food."
  - 18.5 to 24.9: "Normal weight - Keep up the good work!"
  - 25 to 29.9: "Overweight - Consider a balanced diet and exercise."
  - Greater than or equal to 30: "Obesity - Consult a healthcare provider."

### Code Execution
1. The code initializes the weight and height variables with values 70.0 (kg) and 1.75 (m), respectively.
2. The `calculateBMI` function is called with the weight and height values to calculate the BMI.
3. The `getHealthRecommendation` function is called with the calculated BMI to get a health recommendation.
4. The BMI value and the health recommendation are printed to the console.

### Example Usage
```swift
let weight = 70.0  // weight in kilograms
let height = 1.75  // height in meters

let bmi = calculateBMI(weight: weight, height: height)
let recommendation = getHealthRecommendation(bmi: bmi)

print("BMI: \(bmi)")
print("Recommendation: \(recommendation)")
```

### External Libraries or Dependencies
- The code does not rely on any external libraries or dependencies and can be run using the Swift standard library.
  
  ## Component Code
  ```jsx
  import Foundation

func calculateBMI(weight: Double, height: Double) -> Double {
    return weight / (height * height)
}

func getHealthRecommendation(bmi: Double) -> String {
    switch bmi {
    case ..<18.5:
        return "Underweight - You should eat more nutritious food."
    case 18.5..<24.9:
        return "Normal weight - Keep up the good work!"
    case 25..<29.9:
        return "Overweight - Consider a balanced diet and exercise."
    default:
        return "Obesity - Consult a healthcare provider."
    }
}

let weight = 70.0  // weight in kilograms
let height = 1.75  // height in meters

let bmi = calculateBMI(weight: weight, height: height)
let recommendation = getHealthRecommendation(bmi: bmi)

print("BMI: \(bmi)")
print("Recommendation: \(recommendation)")
  ```
